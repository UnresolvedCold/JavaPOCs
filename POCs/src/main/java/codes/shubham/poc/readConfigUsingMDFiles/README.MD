# Reading application.properties from MD files

## Introduction

We wanted to introduce a LLM model that can describe the 
property and help others in understanding the property better.
This will ensure everyone is on the same page and can handle 
the property changes by themselves and be informed.

## Things to test

### Reading the properties from the MD files
### Environment variable support
### Override properties using local properties file (This will be a general .properties file)
